You are alone

The world you occupy is not the world

It is your world

A world of ancient patterns and costumes

Within this world, all is illusion

The only thing which is real, is god

And what god is permitted to touch in that world

If you serve god

You will be permitted glimpses out of your lonely existence in a hall of mirrors

And catch flickers of life from beyond the illusory

At the others, trapped in a maze of impressions

god provides the shining white light of clarity

With which people can gather together

And for a short time, transcend their solipsism

And feel together

To feel as kin

To feel as one in holy union with the divine

This is what god does

god creates love between people who deem themselves unlovable
