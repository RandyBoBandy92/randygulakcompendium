Well, I've got the development build of this site running on my machine. I can see how to create posts, and I can see the website update in real time.

This is all really neat, but I don't have a damned clue how it's doing any of this. So I'd like to work on that here for a bit.

Shouldn't be too hard to sort out how this blog works, right? _right_?
