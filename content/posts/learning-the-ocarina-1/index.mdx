For the past few weeks I have been learning the ocarina.

So I'm going to write about what I've learned so far, as well as _how_ I've learnt it.

Visit my [Ocarina](https://publish.obsidian.md/randybobandy/Ocarina) page on the [garden](https://publish.obsidian.md/randybobandy/Garden+entrance) if you want to see the rough notes

I have ADHD, so staying sufficiently focused in order to really retain and remember things is a challenge. The best strategy I have come across to overcome this, is [spaced repetition](https://publish.obsidian.md/randybobandy/Spaced+Repetition). I will be using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and several plugins in order to create my learning deck. Not going to go into too much detail for now, I may write some more tutorial-like blog posts in the future if there is interest.

# Learning path

I found a [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G9Wz9udYuY&list=PL4hqIpA4A_CdHpfc_hqLVall6_EQbm4rU) with what seemed like a well rounded beginners guide, it even has an intro to music theory which I need to learn to, awesome!

I watched the videos, and whenever a useful image came up that I want to practice, I took a screenshot, and added it to my deck.

I also grabbed any exercises that I thought I'd need to repeat more than once.

# Why this is cool (to me)

Being able to overcome the limitations of my own attention span, and still make real measurable progress in learning this musical instrument brings me a lot of joy. This technique helped me get a 4.0 GPA during my first year of university, while my grades in high school (prior to the discovery of anki) were abysmal. I hope to talk more about
new technologies/methodologies for learning, and I'll continue to post more ocarina updates as I progress.
