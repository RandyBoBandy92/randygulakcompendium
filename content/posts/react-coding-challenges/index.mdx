[Found a GitHub repo](https://github.com/alexgurr/react-coding-challenges) with some react coding challenges.
Here's some excerpts from my working log as I worked through these challenges.

## Rocket Ship Challenge

Requirements:

- stop the class component rocket from taking off
- stop the functional rocket component from taking off

so I'll need to code in some changes to the components lifecycles.

Let's take a look at the code.

```js
export default function LaunchPad() {
  const [rerenderCount, triggerRerender] = useState(0);

  setTimeout(() => {
    triggerRerender(rerenderCount + 1);
  }, 500);

  return (
    <div className="launchpad">
      <ClassRocket />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Launchpad has a piece of state called rerenderCount, by default set to 0.

So, the timeout triggers the component to rerender

let's look at the rocket.js component next

```js
import React, { useState, Component } from "react";
import RocketCore from "./RocketCore";

export function FunctionalRocket() {
  const [initialLaunchTime] = useState(Date.now());

  return <RocketCore initialLaunchTime={initialLaunchTime} />;
}

export class ClassRocket extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      initialLaunchTime: Date.now(),
    };
  }

  render() {
    const { initialLaunchTime } = this.state;

    return <RocketCore initialLaunchTime={initialLaunchTime} />;
  }
}
```

- [x] Prevent FunctionalRocket from rerendering

  To accomplish this, all I did was convert FunctionalRocket from a function into a const, and then wrapped it in a `React.memo`

```js
export const FunctionalRocket = React.memo(() => {
  const [initialLaunchTime] = useState(Date.now());

  return <RocketCore initialLaunchTime={initialLaunchTime} />;
});
```

- [x] Prevent ClassRocket from rerendering

  I changed the class from an extension of Component to PureComponent, which prevented it from rerendering by default

```js
export class ClassRocket extends PureComponent {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      initialLaunchTime: Date.now(),
    };
  }

  render() {
    const { initialLaunchTime } = this.state;

    return <RocketCore initialLaunchTime={initialLaunchTime} />;
  }
}
```

Nice!

## Dark-Mode Challenge

Requirements:

- Add the ability to switch to dark mode to the already existing button

This can be accomplished by adding a `dark-mode` class to the root html element, though I elected to add it to the document.body instead.

in App.js i created some state, and a function to toggle dark-mode on and off by adding/removing a class to the document body

```js
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);

  const toggleDarkMode = () => {
    if (!darkMode) {
      document.body.classList.add("dark-mode");
    } else {
      document.body.classList.remove("dark-mode");
    }
    setDarkMode(!darkMode);
  };
 ...
  <button
	  onClick={toggleDarkMode}
	  className="app__dark-mode-btn icon level-right"
	>
	  {darkMode ? (
		<FontAwesomeIcon color="#FFA500" icon={faSun} />
	  ) : (
		<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faMoon} />
	  )}
  </button>
```

It asks in the readme:

- How we would use Dark mode on other potential routes/components in a bigger application. Would your solution work for this?

There would need to be more components abstracted out of this App.js, since the button would be getting rendered on pages which all share a common \_main.scss which in turn imports \_dark-mode.scss, the button can track it's own state and contain it's own functionality without the need to pass state down from the App to the button.
I would probably change the useState to draw the initial value from localStorage, and then to save that value each time the button is clicked, preserving the users preference between visits/reloads.

I tried this and wrote some code to do that and preserve user preference.

```js
const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(
  localStorage.getItem("darkMode") === null
    ? "false"
    : localStorage.getItem("darkMode")
);

const toggleDarkMode = () => {
  if (darkMode === "false") {
    document.body.classList.add("dark-mode");
  } else {
    document.body.classList.remove("dark-mode");
  }
  localStorage.setItem("darkMode", darkMode === "false" ? "true" : "false");
  setDarkMode(localStorage.getItem("darkMode"));
};

useEffect(() => {
  if (darkMode === "true") {
    document.body.classList.add("dark-mode");
  }
}, []);
```

There is a small flicker where the page opens in default colors before adding the dark-mode class, but this is good enough for me for now.

## "Spootify" Challenge

Requirements:

- [x] Fetch and display _Released This Week_ songs
  - Use the API path `new-releases`
- [x] Fetch and display _Featured Playlists_
  - Use the API path `featured-playlists`
- [x] Fetch and display _Browse_ genres
  - Use the API path `categories`
- [ ] Loading state/UI _(optional, current UX is already clean)_

I found the Spotify authorization guide [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)

and the API reference docs [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-categories)

I found this quite challenging and admittedly had to peek at the solution before I could figure out what Authorization/Request method didn't throw a CORS error.
But I vowed not to copy it, because I am a man of principle, also their code was very abstracted and confusing.

This ain't stackoverflow, I will not copy paste!

The main component that renders all the content coming from the API is Discover.js

This is a class component, and as I am less familiar with class component syntax the first thing I did was convert it to functional, and replace the state for the 3 arrays with useState.

### Authorization & Requesting Data

After many attempts I realized that the "Client Credential Flow" is the correct flow to use for this type of application. Granted, the proper way to do things would be to shield my ClientId/Secret behind a backend to handle these requests, but since this challenge is designed to only have a client, this will do.

Took me a little while to wrap my head around the proper content-types and how to encode the authorization in base64, but I eventually got it figured out.

The curl examples in the Auth documentation simplified things for me a great deal, showing me what was essential for my request. I then popped open the docs for axios, to make sure I shaped my data correctly.

```js
import axios from "axios";
import apiData from "../config.js";
import base64 from "base-64";

const getToken = async () => {
  const response = await axios({
    method: "post",
    url: apiData.authUrl,
    headers: {
      "content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      Authorization: `Basic ${base64.encode(
        `${apiData.clientId}:${apiData.clientSecret}`
      )}`,
    },
    data: "grant_type=client_credentials",
  });
  return response.data.access_token;
};

export const getNewReleases = async () => {
  const token = await getToken();
  try {
    const response = await axios({
      method: "get",
      url: apiData.baseUrl + "/browse/new-releases",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};

export const getFeaturedPlaylists = async () => {
  const token = await getToken();
  try {
    const response = await axios({
      method: "get",
      url: apiData.baseUrl + "/browse/featured-playlists",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};

export const getAllCategories = async () => {
  const token = await getToken();
  try {
    const response = await axios({
      method: "get",
      url: apiData.baseUrl + "/browse/categories",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};
```

### UI Implementation

Back in Discover.js, I used an empty array useEffect to do a one-time load in of my API data after first mount.

```js
const Discover = () => {
  const [newReleases, setNewReleases] = useState([]);
  const [playlists, setPlaylists] = useState([]);
  const [categories, setCategories] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    getNewReleases().then((data) => {
      setNewReleases(data.albums.items);
    });

    getFeaturedPlaylists().then((data) => {
      setPlaylists(data.playlists.items);
    });

    getAllCategories().then((data) => {
      setCategories(data.categories.items);
    });
  }, []);
...
```

Again, I probably could have added another layer of Async/Await and promises to get a smoother "loading/pending" state, however the content seemed to load in rather quickly, and I didn't want to make this any more complicated than I already found it.

I enjoyed these exercises, I did them to procrastinate on another project I am currently undertaking in the [garden](https://publish.obsidian.md/randybobandy/Garden+entrance)
where I am working my way through Front-End technical interview questions in order to test my knowledge. I will create a blog post here once I have things completed, but the in-progress
work can be [accessed there](https://publish.obsidian.md/randybobandy/Creating+a+web+developer+knowledge+garden).

k bye
