As discussed [previously](https://randygulak.com/learning-the-ocarina-w-spaced-repetition-update-1), I want to learn how to play [The Flute Tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwLSrNu1ppI) by Soulpride.

I managed to track down some sheet music

**But** it's in the wrong key, I don't know what key it is, and I don't know what most of these notes mean.

**\*_googles furiously_\***

So apparantly I can do something called "transposing" to bring it down to the key of my Ocarina.

It appears my options are:

1. Learn how to do this
2. Find an application that already does this

...so I found this neat app called [musescore](https://musescore.com/) and was able to transpose the sheet music.

Only one problem, my ape brain still doesn't understand 75% of these dang squiggly lines.

It appears my options are:

1. ~~Learn how to do this~~
2. ~~Find an application that already does this~~
3. Learn how to write sheet music (badly)

ok so there's a free program called [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) that does exactly what I need.

Let's read the docs for 5 minutes and then mash a bunch of garbage into a text file in vim until it starts to make sense, shall we?

```
  \header {
  title = "The Flute Tune (Soulpride Remix) - Ocarina"
  }

  \relative
  {
           \time 4/4
           \clef "treble"
           \key c \major
           \tempo 4 = 120
           a' a a b c b a
           d, d d f a
           b b b c
           a a a b g g
           f f e e d d c c d e e2 r2
           f4 g a a r8 a b a g
  }
```

and uhh... VOILA!

But not bad, hey?

This was fun, I had to come up with the notes myself by ear which is not something I've ever done before.

It ain't perfect, but..
